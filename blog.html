                <p>Entry 14 (November 11, 2024, 01:07) America, fuck you. How can we be so dumb as to not realize that Trump is a tyrant? <br><br>For one, his tariffs will only make things more expensive for us in the long run, unless he manages to make more industry in the U.S., which is unlikely considering how horrible he was at creating jobs last time. <br><br>He was never good for the economy; he took credit for Obama's economy, then fucked it, but somehow that's Biden's fault. <br><br>And oh Lord, his policy on queer people is tyrannical and downright fascist. <br><br>Good luck, and stay safe, peeps.

                <p> Entry 11 (Febuary 29, 2024, 00:33) I'm going to write this somewhere where I know it won't be read by anyone, atleast immediately. Someone I heavily looked up to turns out to be a fuckhead, this will be the third time this has happened. (Wilbur Soot) hurt seemingly many people directly, and now is hurting many people indirectly. I was an enjoyer for a long time, but no, fuck him. #ShelbySupportSquad, #FuckWilburSoot. Donate to a good charity if you can. My choice was Joyful Heart.

                    Entry 1 (July 10, 2023, 17:52): Hi! This is my first blog post on this site, I'm not sure this is the best way to do it,
                    directly changing the html to make the post, but it'll work for now!
